description: |
  <p class="lead">I am a PhD student in the School of Computational
  Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned
  a Masterâ€™s degree in experimental condensed matter physics at Brigham
  Young University where I fabricated and characterized thin-films
  and carbon nanotubes used in nanostructured high capacity battery
  electrodes and in X-ray windows. As an undergraduate, I studied
  theoretical physics and researched the evolution of chaotic systems
  using neural networks at Westminster College. I am a trainee is an
  NSF IGERT <a target="_blank"

  FLAMEL</a>  program, and one of the lead developers on
  <a target="_blank" href="http://pymks.org/">PyMKS</a> materials
  informatics toolkit. My current research interest is creating tools
  and protocols that efficiently leverage large datasets to learn
  structure-processing and structure-property relationships.
